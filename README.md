RAG Model for Financial QA Bot
Overview
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model designed for answering financial queries related to Profit & Loss (P&L) statements extracted from PDF documents. The project includes a backend pipeline for data processing and a user-friendly interactive interface for querying financial data. It is developed to demonstrate cutting-edge AI capabilities in financial data extraction and question answering, making it a valuable addition to a professional portfolio.

Features

1. Data Extraction and Preprocessing
   o Extracts P&L tables from PDFs using Camelot and pdfplumber.
   o Cleans and converts extracted data into structured formats (e.g., Pandas DataFrames).
2. RAG Model Pipeline
   o Embeds financial terms and metrics using Sentence Transformers.
   o Stores embeddings in FAISS, a high-performance vector database for efficient retrieval.
   o Implements a RAG-based pipeline to retrieve relevant financial information and generate human-like answers.
3. Interactive Interface
   o Built with Streamlit, allowing users to:
    Upload PDF documents containing P&L statements.
    Query financial data in natural language (e.g., "What is the gross profit for Q3 2024?").
    View relevant financial data alongside generated answers.
4. Performance Optimization
   o Handles large P&L documents and multiple queries efficiently.
   o Ensures accurate parsing and retrieval of financial terms.

How It Works

1. Data Extraction:
   o Upload a PDF document containing P&L statements.
   o Extract tabular data using Camelot or pdfplumber.
2. Embedding and Retrieval:
   o Generate embeddings for extracted financial terms using Sentence Transformers.
   o Store embeddings in a FAISS vector database.
   o Retrieve relevant data segments based on user queries.
3. Answer Generation:
   o Use a pre-trained Hugging Face transformer model to generate responses from retrieved data.
   o Display the relevant data alongside the generated answer in the interface.
4. User Interaction:
   o Query examples:
    "What are the total expenses for Q2 2023?"
    "Show the operating margin for the past 6 months."
   o Receive accurate and contextually relevant answers in real time.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
• Python 3.9+
• Virtual environment (optional but recommended)
Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. git clone https://github.com/username/RAG_Model_Development.git
3. cd RAG_Model_Development
4. Create and activate a virtual environment:
5. python -m venv venv
6. source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
7. Install dependencies:
8. pip install -r requirements.txt
9. Install Ghostscript (required for Camelot):
   o Download Ghostscript
   o Add Ghostscript to your system's PATH.
   Example Queries
   Here are some examples of financial queries the QA bot can handle:
   • "What is the gross profit for Q3 2024?"
   • "How do the net income and operating expenses compare for Q1 2024?"
   • "What are the total expenses for the past year?"

Challenges and Solutions

1. PDF Parsing Variability:
   o Different P&L formats required robust handling with tools like Camelot and pdfplumber.
2. Embedding Accuracy:
   o Fine-tuned Sentence Transformers to enhance retrieval performance.
3. Latency Optimization:
   o Used FAISS for efficient nearest-neighbor searches, reducing response time.
