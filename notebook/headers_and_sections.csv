2.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Accounting policy
Business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.
Thepurchasepriceinanacquisitionismeasuredatthefair valueoftheassetstransferred,equityinstrumentsissued andliabilities incurredor assumedatthedate
of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of
acquisition.Contingentconsiderationisremeasuredatfairvalueateachreportingdateandchangesinthefairvalueofthecontingentconsiderationarerecognized
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations between entities under common control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's
consolidated financial statements.
The payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially
recognizedattheestimatedpresentvalueofgrossobligations.Suchoptionsaresubsequentlymeasuredatfairvalueinordertoreflecttheamountpayableunderthe

are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected
residual value atthe end ofitslife. The Group depreciates property, plantand equipment over their estimated usefullives usingthe straight-line method. The estimated usefullives ofassets are as
follows:
Buildings (1) 22-25 years
Plant and machinery (1)(2) 5 years
Office equipment 5 years
Computer equipment (1) 3-5 years
Furniture and fixtures (1) 5 years

economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial
statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
Ifsuchassetsare considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized intheConsolidated StatementofProfitand Lossismeasuredbytheamountbywhichthecarryingvalueoftheassets

determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:

2.3 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2.3.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
GoodwillrepresentsthepurchaseconsiderationinexcessoftheGroup'sinterestinthenetfairvalueofidentifiableassets,liabilitiesandcontingentliabilitiesoftheacquiredentity.Whenthenetfair
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is
recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the
impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit fromthe synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowestlevel atwhich goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair
value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived fromthe CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flowprojections are prepared
based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.
Following is a summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:
(In ₹ crore)

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

Accounting policy
Intangibleassetsarestatedatcostlessaccumulatedamortizationandimpairment.Intangibleassetsareamortizedovertheirrespectiveindividualestimatedusefullivesonastraight-linebasis,from
the date that theyare available for use. The estimated usefullife ofan identifiable intangible asset is based on a number offactors includingthe effectsof obsolescence, demand, competition, and

implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group’s core and digital offerings (together called as “software related services”) and business process
management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.

price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of
satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.
The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price

patternofbenefitsfromthe servicesrendered to the customer and the Group’s coststo fulfil the contract is not even throughthe period of contract because the services are generally
discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
Progresstowardscompletionismeasured asthe ratio ofcostsor effortsincurred to date (representingworkperformed) to the estimated total costsor efforts. Estimates oftransaction
price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates
are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are
recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based billing and / or milestone based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as
unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).
In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the
arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction
price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item

rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.
Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the

1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are
considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are
committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a
contractandidentifiesdistinctperformanceobligationsinthecontract.Identificationofdistinctperformanceobligationstodeterminethedeliverablesandthe
abilityofthe customer to benefit independentlyfromsuch deliverables, and allocationof transactionprice to these distinct performance obligationsinvolves
significant judgment.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts
over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of
benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the
services are generallydiscrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.

involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.

b. Income taxes
The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax
positions.
Inassessingtherealizabilityofdeferredincometaxassets,theManagementconsiderswhethersomeportionorallofthedeferredincometaxassetswillnotbe
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible
differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).
c. Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent
consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations
are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option
arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1).
