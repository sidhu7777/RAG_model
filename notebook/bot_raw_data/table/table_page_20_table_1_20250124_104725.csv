2.10.4 Fair value of financial instruments
"In determining the fair value of
its financial
instruments,
the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each"
"reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer"
"quotes.  All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized."
"Refer
to table 'Financial
instruments by category' below for
the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For
financial assets and liabilities"
"maturing within one year
from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at
fair value,
the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these"
instruments.
2.10.5 Impairment
"The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss."
"Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets,"
"ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at"
lifetime ECL.
"The Group determines
the allowance for credit
losses based on historical
loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group"
considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.
The amount of ECL (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required to be recorded is recognized as an impairment loss
or gain in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
