e. Impairment of Goodwill
"Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that
the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGUs) is less"
"than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and"
which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
"The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based on higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost
to sell. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections"
"are prepared based on current economic conditions and comprises estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating"
margins (Refer to Note 2.3.1).
