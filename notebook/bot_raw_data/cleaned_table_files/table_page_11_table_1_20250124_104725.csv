2. Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
2.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Accounting policy
"Business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations."
"The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at
the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at
the date"
"of acquisition, which is the date on which control
is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration."
"Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their
fair value on the date of"
acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
"The interest of non-controlling shareholders
is
initially measured either at
fair value or at
the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of
the acquiree’s"
"identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent
to acquisition,
the carrying amount of non-"
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
"Business combinations between entities under common control
is accounted for at carrying value of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's"
consolidated financial statements.
"The payments
related to options
issued by the Group over
the non-controlling interests
in its
subsidiaries
are
accounted as
financial
liabilities
and initially"
recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently measured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable under the
"option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized."
"Acquisitions during the year ended March 31, 2023"
