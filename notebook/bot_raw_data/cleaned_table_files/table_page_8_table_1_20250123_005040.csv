1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements
"These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements are prepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34 Interim Financial"
"Reporting , under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial
instruments which are measured at fair values,
the provisions of"
"the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') and guidelines
issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI). Accordingly,
these interim condensed"
"consolidated financial statements do not
include all
the information required for a complete set of financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated"
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report for
"the year ended March 31, 2023. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)"
"Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter."
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting
standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.
"As the quarter and year-to-date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the quarter figures in this statement added up to the figures"
reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-to-date figures reported in this statement.
1.3 Basis of consolidation
"Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements comprise the financial
statements of
the"
"Company,
its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity,
is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from"
"its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that"
"give the ability to direct relevant activities,
those which significantly affect the entity's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences"
until the date control ceases.
The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain /
"loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at
the"
"Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of
the net profit or
loss and net assets of subsidiaries
that are not, directly or
indirectly, owned or"
"controlled by the Company, are excluded."
1.4 Use of estimates and judgments
"The preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management
to make estimates, judgments"
"and assumptions. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,"
the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and
the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.5 . Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding
the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which changes are
"made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements."
