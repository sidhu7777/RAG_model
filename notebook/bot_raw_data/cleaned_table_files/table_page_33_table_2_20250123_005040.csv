Accounting Policy
The Group as a lessee
"The Group’s lease asset classes consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a"
"contract. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if
the contract conveys the right
to control
the use of an identified asset
for a period of
time in exchange for"
"consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the"
"use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset
through the period of the lease and (3) the Group"
has the right to direct the use of the asset.
"At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in"
"which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases,"
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
"As a lessee,
the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease,
if the use"
"of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it
is"
"reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any"
"significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to"
"Group’s
operations taking into account
the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is"
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.
"Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes"
these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
"The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or"
"prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated"
depreciation and impairment losses.
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful
life of the underlying"
asset.
Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
"For
the purpose of
impairment
testing,
the recoverable amount
(i.e.
the higher of
the fair value less cost
to sell and the value-in-use)
is determined on an"
"individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of
those from other assets.
In such cases,
the recoverable"
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
"The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at
the present value of
the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the"
"interest
rate implicit
in the lease or,
if not
readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of
these leases. Lease"
"liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment
to the related right-of-use asset
if the Group changes its assessment
if whether it will exercise an"
extension or a termination option.
