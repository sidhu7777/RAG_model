"The purchase price in an acquisition is measured at
the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at
the date",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of acquisition, which is the date on which control
is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent
liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at
their
fair value on the date of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interest of non-controlling shareholders
is
initially measured either at
fair value or at
the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of
the acquiree’s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent
to acquisition,
the carrying amount of non-",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"impairment
test, goodwill
is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest
level at which goodwill

"internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2.3.2  Intangible Assets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accounting policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Intangible assets are stated at cost
less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful
lives on a straight-line basis, from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the date that
they are available for use. The estimated useful
life of an identifiable intangible asset
is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asset.  Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project
is demonstrated, future economic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"benefits are probable,
the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell
the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Impairment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"recoverable amount
(i.e.
the higher of the fair value less cost
to sell and the value-in-use)
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment
to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment
loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of
the asset
is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that
this amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"In determining the fair value of
its financial
instruments,
the Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, available quoted market prices and dealer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"quotes.  All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Refer
to table 'Financial
instruments by category' below for
the disclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For
financial assets and liabilities",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"maturing within one year
from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at
fair value,
the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
instruments.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.10.5 Impairment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit
loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
lifetime ECL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group determines
the allowance for credit
losses based on historical
loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
considers current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accounting Policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Group as a lessee,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group’s lease asset classes consist of leases for land, buildings and computers. The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"contract. A contract
is, or contains, a lease if
the contract conveys the right
to control
the use of an identified asset
for a period of
time in exchange for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the group assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset
through the period of the lease and (3) the Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
has the right to direct the use of the asset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset (“ROU”) and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a lessee,
the Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease,
if the use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it
is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Group’s
operations taking into account
the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or
terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost
less accumulated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
depreciation and impairment losses.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful
life of the underlying",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
asset.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For
the purpose of
impairment
testing,
the recoverable amount
(i.e.
the higher of
the fair value less cost
to sell and the value-in-use)
is determined on an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of
those from other assets.
In such cases,
the recoverable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at
the present value of
the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"interest
rate implicit
in the lease or,
if not
readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of
these leases. Lease",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment
to the related right-of-use asset
if the Group changes its assessment
if whether it will exercise an",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
extension or a termination option.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Group as a lessor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Leases for which the Group is a lessor,is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever,,the terms of,the lease transfer substantially all,the risks and,,,,,,,,,,,
"rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When the Group is an intermediate lessor,",,it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

INFOSYS LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overview and notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Overview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.1 Company overview,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Infosys Limited ('the Company' or
Infosys) provides consulting,
technology, outsourcing and next-generation digital
services,
to enable clients
to execute",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"strategies for their digital
transformation. Infosys strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant
to the agenda of clients, while",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plan and execute on their journey to a digital future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Infosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is hereinafter referred to as ""the Group"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India and has
its
registered office at Electronics city, Hosur Road, Bengaluru",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"560100, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company’s American",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group's interim condensed consolidated financial statements are approved for issue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 18, 2024.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements are prepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 34 Interim Financial",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Reporting , under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial
instruments which are measured at fair values,
the provisions of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') and guidelines
issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of
India (SEBI). Accordingly,
these interim condensed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"consolidated financial statements do not
include all
the information required for a complete set of financial statements. These interim condensed consolidated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report for,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"the year ended March 31, 2023. The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Accounting policies have been consistently applied except where a newly issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. The material accounting policy information used in preparation of the audited condensed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
consolidated interim financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the quarter and year-to-date figures are taken from the source and rounded to the nearest digits, the quarter figures in this statement added up to the figures",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-to-date figures reported in this statement.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.3 Basis of consolidation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Infosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The interim condensed consolidated financial
statements comprise the financial
statements of
the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Company,
its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity,
is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect
those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"give the ability to direct relevant activities,
those which significantly affect the entity's returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
until the date control ceases.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain /,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at
the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of
the net profit or
loss and net assets of subsidiaries
that are not, directly or
indirectly, owned or",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"controlled by the Company, are excluded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.4 Use of estimates and judgments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management
to make estimates, judgments",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and assumptions. These estimates,
judgments and assumptions affect
the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note no. 1.5 . Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
the estimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which changes are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a. Revenue recognition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group’s contracts with customers
include promises
to transfer multiple products and services
to a customer. Revenues
from customer contracts are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"considered for
recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved,
in writing, by the parties
to the contract,
the parties
to contract are",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract
is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ability of the customer to benefit
independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
significant judgment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of
repetitive acts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract
is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil
the contract
is not even through the period of
the contract because the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements.
In these",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so,
the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
or costs to complete the contract.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b. Income taxes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Significant
judgments are
involved in determining the provision for
income
taxes,
including amount
expected to be paid /
recovered for uncertain tax",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
positions.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections
for
future taxable income over
the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"periods
in which the deferred income
tax assets
are deductible,
the Management believes
that
the Group will
realize
the benefits of
those deductible",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"differences. The amount of
the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near
term if estimates of
future taxable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
c. Business combinations and intangible assets,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.
Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"are
conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates
are
required to be made
in determining the value of
contingent
consideration, value of option",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"arrangements and intangible
assets. These measurements are based on information available
at
the
acquisition date
and are based on expectations
and",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"d. Property, plant and equipment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful
life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful
lives and residual values of Group's",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically,
including at each financial year end. The lives are based",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact
their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
