2.3 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2.3.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
"Goodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of the Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. When the net fair"
"value of
the identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration,
the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is"
recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
"Goodwill
is tested for
impairment on an annual basis and whenever
there is an indication that
the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit
(CGU)
is less than its carrying amount. For
the"
"impairment
test, goodwill
is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowest
level at which goodwill
is monitored for"
"internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest
identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets."
"Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair"
"value less cost
to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow projections are prepared"
"based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins."
Following is a summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:

"For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition."
2.3.2  Intangible Assets
Accounting policy
"Intangible assets are stated at cost
less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful
lives on a straight-line basis, from"
"the date that
they are available for use. The estimated useful
life of an identifiable intangible asset
is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and"
"other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the"
asset.  Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.
"Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project
is demonstrated, future economic"
"benefits are probable,
the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell
the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of"
"material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use."
Impairment
"Intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the"
"recoverable amount
(i.e.
the higher of the fair value less cost
to sell and the value-in-use)
is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely"
"independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs."
"If such assets are considered to be impaired,
the impairment
to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets"
"exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment
loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine"
"the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of
the asset
is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that
this amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been"
determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
