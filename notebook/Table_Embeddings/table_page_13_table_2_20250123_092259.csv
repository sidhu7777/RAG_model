"2.2 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT",,,,,,,,,
Accounting policy,,,,,,,,,
,"Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly attributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, plant and equipment",,,,,,,,
,"are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful",,,,,,,,life and the expected
residual value at,"the end of its life. The Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful",,,,,lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful,,,lives of assets are as
follows:,,,,,,,,,
Buildings (1),22-25 years,,,,,,,,
Plant and machinery (1)(2),5 years,,,,,,,,
Office equipment,5 years,,,,,,,,
Computer equipment (1),3-5 years,,,,,,,,
Furniture and fixtures (1),5 years,,,,,,,,
Vehicles(1),5 years,,,,,,,,
Leasehold improvements,,Lower of useful life of the asset or lease term,,,,,,,
"(1) Based on technical evaluation,","the Management believes that
the useful",,lives as given above best represent,,,"the period over which the Management expects to use these assets. Hence,",,,the useful
,lives for these assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of Schedule II of the Companies Act 2013,,,,,,,,
(2)  Includes Solar plant with a useful life of 25 years,,,,,,,,,
,"Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as",,,,,,,,
,"anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology.",,,,,,,,
,"Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified as capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost of assets",,,,,,,,
,"not ready to use before such date are disclosed under ‘Capital work-in-progress’. Subsequent expenditures relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is probable that future",,,,,,,,
,economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial,,,,,,,,
statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.,,,,,,,,,
Impairment,,,,,,,,,
"Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for",recoverability whenever events or changes,,,in circumstances,indicate that,,their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For,,the purpose of
"impairment
testing,
the recoverable amount (i.e.",the higher of the fair value less cost,,,to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash,,,,,
,"flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.",,,,,,,,
"If such assets are considered to be impaired,",the impairment,to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets,,,,,,,
exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment,,loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine,,,,,,,
the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of,the asset,"is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that",,,,this amount does not exceed the carrying amount,,,that would have been
,determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.,,,,,,,,
