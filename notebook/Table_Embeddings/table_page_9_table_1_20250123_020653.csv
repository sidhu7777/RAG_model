1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
"The Group’s contracts with customers
include promises
to transfer multiple products and services
to a customer. Revenues
from customer contracts are"
"considered for
recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved,
in writing, by the parties
to the contract,
the parties
to contract are"
"committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract
is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a"
contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the
"ability of the customer to benefit
independently from such deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these distinct performance obligations involves"
significant judgment.
"Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of
repetitive acts"
"over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract
is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of"
"benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil
the contract
is not even through the period of
the contract because the"
services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Group uses the percentage-of-completion method in accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the
Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended
have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs
involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.
"Contracts with customers includes subcontractor services or
third-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated services arrangements.
In these"
"types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the"
"customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so,
the Group first evaluates whether it obtains control of the"
"specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it
is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to"
"provide the specified goods or services, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and"
"therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent."
"Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts"
or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
"The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions."
"Significant
judgments are
involved in determining the provision for
income
taxes,
including amount
expected to be paid /
recovered for uncertain tax"
positions.
"In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be"
"realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which the"
"temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income"
"and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical
taxable income and projections
for
future taxable income over
the"
"periods
in which the deferred income
tax assets
are deductible,
the Management believes
that
the Group will
realize
the benefits of
those deductible"
"differences. The amount of
the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near
term if estimates of
future taxable"
income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).
c. Business combinations and intangible assets
"Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.
Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent"
"consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent
liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations"
"are
conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates
are
required to be made
in determining the value of
contingent
consideration, value of option"
"arrangements and intangible
assets. These measurements are based on information available
at
the
acquisition date
and are based on expectations
and"
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1).
"d. Property, plant and equipment"
"Property, plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after"
"determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful
life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful
lives and residual values of Group's"
"assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically,
including at each financial year end. The lives are based"
"on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact
their life, such as changes in technology (Refer to Note"
2.2).
