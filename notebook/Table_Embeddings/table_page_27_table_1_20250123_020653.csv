2.14  PROVISIONS
Accounting policy
"A provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event,
the Group has a present
legal or constructive obligation that
is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that"
an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate
that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
a. Post sales client support
"The Group provides its clients with a fixed-period post sales support on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs associated with such support services are"
"accrued at
the time related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs based on historical"
experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.
b. Onerous contracts
"Provisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower
than the unavoidable costs of"
"meeting the future obligations under the contract. Provisions for estimated losses,
if any, on incomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses"
become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of
terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the
assets associated with that contract.
