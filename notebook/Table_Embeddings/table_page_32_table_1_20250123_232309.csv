Accounting policy
Gratuity and Pensions
"The Group provides
for gratuity,
a defined benefit
retirement plan ('the Gratuity Plan')
covering eligible
employees majorly of
Infosys
and its
Indian"
"subsidiaries. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump-sum payment
to vested employees at retirement, death,
incapacitation or termination of employment, of an"
amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment with the Group. The Company contributes Gratuity liabilities to the Infosys
"Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust (the Trust). In case of Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve, contributions are made to the Infosys BPM Employees' Gratuity"
"Fund Trust
and EdgeVerve Systems Limited Employees' Gratuity Fund Trust,
respectively. Trustees
administer
contributions made
to the Trusts
and"
contributions are invested in a scheme with the Life Insurance Corporation of India as permitted by Indian law.
"The Group operates defined benefit pension plan in certain overseas jurisdictions,
in accordance with the local
laws. These plans are managed by third party"
fund managers. The plans provide for periodic payouts after retirement and/or for a lumpsum payment as set out in rules of each fund and includes death and
"disability benefits. The defined benefit plans
require contributions which are based on a percentage of
salary that varies depending on the age of
the"
respective employees.
"Liabilities with regard to these defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial valuation, performed by an external actuary, at each Balance Sheet date using"
"the projected unit credit method. These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk,  interest rate risk and market risk."
The Group recognizes the net obligation of a defined benefit plan in its Balance Sheet as an asset or liability. Gains and losses through re-measurements of
"the net defined benefit
liability / (asset) are recognized in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. The"
"actual return of the portfolio of plan assets,
in excess of the yields computed by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation is"
recognized in other comprehensive income. The effect of any plan amendments is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Provident fund
"Eligible employees of
Infosys receive benefits from a provident
fund, which is a defined benefit plan. Both the eligible employee and the Company make"
"monthly contributions to the provident fund plan equal
to a specified percentage of the covered employee's salary. The Company contributes a portion to the"
"Infosys Limited Employees' Provident Fund Trust. The trust
invests in specific designated instruments as permitted by Indian law. The remaining portion is"
"contributed to the government
administered pension fund. The
rate
at which the
annual
interest
is payable
to the beneficiaries by the
trust
is being"
"administered by the Government of India. The Company has an obligation to make good the shortfall,
if any, between the return from the investments of the"
trust and the notified interest rate.
"In respect of Indian subsidiaries, eligible employees receive benefits from a provident fund, which is a defined contribution plan. Both the eligible employee"
"and the respective companies make monthly contributions
to this provident
fund plan equal
to a specified percentage of
the covered employee's
salary."
Amounts collected under the provident fund plan are deposited in a government administered provident fund. The Companies have no further obligation to
the plan beyond its monthly contributions.
Superannuation
"Certain employees of Infosys, Infosys BPM and EdgeVerve are participants in a defined contribution plan. The Group has no further obligations to the plan"
"beyond its monthly contributions which are periodically contributed to a trust fund,
the corpus of which is invested with the Life Insurance Corporation of"
India.
Compensated absences
"The Group has
a policy on compensated absences which are both accumulating and non-accumulating in nature. The
expected cost of
accumulating"
compensated absences is determined by actuarial valuation performed by an external actuary at each Balance Sheet date using projected unit credit method on
"the additional amount expected to be paid/availed as a result of
the unused entitlement
that has accumulated at
the Balance Sheet date. Expense on non-"
accumulating compensated absences is recognized in the period in which the absences occur.
