71.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments
a. Revenue recognition
The Group’s contracts with customers include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues from customer contracts are
considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are
committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Group assesses the services promised in a
contractandidentifiesdistinctperformanceobligationsinthecontract.Identificationofdistinctperformanceobligationstodeterminethedeliverablesandthe
abilityofthe customer to benefit independentlyfromsuch deliverables, and allocationof transactionprice to these distinct performance obligationsinvolves
significant judgment.
Fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts
over a specified period. Revenue from fixed price maintenance contract is recognized ratably using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of
benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group’s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of the contract because the
services are generallydiscrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the
promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.
The Group usesthe percentage-of-completion method inaccountingfor otherfixed-price contracts.Useofthe percentage-of-completionmethod requiresthe

or costs to complete the contract.
b. Income taxes
The Group's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the United States, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax
positions.
Inassessingtherealizabilityofdeferredincometaxassets,theManagementconsiderswhethersomeportionorallofthedeferredincometaxassetswillnotbe
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the
temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income
and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the
periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible
differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable
income during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to Notes 2.15).
c. Business combinations and intangible assets
Business combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable intangible assets and contingent
consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. These valuations
are conducted by external valuation experts. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option
arrangements and intangible assets. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and
assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (Refer to Note 2.1).

2.1 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Accounting policy
Business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations.
Thepurchasepriceinanacquisitionismeasuredatthefair valueoftheassetstransferred,equityinstrumentsissued andliabilities incurredor assumedatthedate
of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of
acquisition.Contingentconsiderationisremeasuredatfairvalueateachreportingdateandchangesinthefairvalueofthecontingentconsiderationarerecognized
in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s
identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-
controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.
Business combinations between entities under common control is accounted for at carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's
consolidated financial statements.
The payments related to options issued by the Group over the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially
recognizedattheestimatedpresentvalueofgrossobligations.Suchoptionsaresubsequentlymeasuredatfairvalueinordertoreflecttheamountpayableunderthe
option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. In the event that the option expires unexercised, the liability is derecognized.
Acquisitions during the year ended March 31, 2023
During the year ended March 31, 2023 the Group, completed two business combinations to complement its digital offerings by acquiring 100% voting interests in:
1) oddity GmbH, oddity group services GmbH, oddity space GmbH, oddity jungle GmbH, oddity code GmbH and oddity waves GmbH (collectively known as
oddity), a Germany-based digital marketing, experience, and commerce agencies on April 20, 2022.
2) BASE life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the life Science industry in Europe on September 1, 2022.
These acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group’s creative, branding and experience design capabilities and augment the Group’s life sciences expertise,
scales its digital transformation capabilities with cloud based industry solutions and expand its presence across Europe.
The purchase price is allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon determination of fair values at the dates of acquisition as follows:

are the value of the acquired assembled workforce and estimated synergies, neither of which qualify as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is not tax-deductible. Goodwill pertaining to these business combinations is allocated to operating segments as more fully described in Note 2.3.1.
The purchase consideration of ₹981 crore includes cash of ₹936 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of ₹45 crore as on the date of
acquisition.
At the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination of the fair value of contingent consideration are the probabilities assigned towards achievement of
financial targets and discount rate of 12.5%. As of March 31, 2024 the contingent consideration was fully paid.
Additionally, these acquisitions have shareholder and employee retention bonus payable to the employees of the acquiree over three years, subject to their
continuous employment with the Group along with achievement of financial targets for the respective years. Performance and Retention Bonus is recognized in
employee benefit expenses in the Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Statement of Profit or Loss over the period of service.
Fair value of trade receivables acquired, is ₹111 crore as of acquisition date and as of March 31, 2024 the amounts are fully collected.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connectionwith a business combinationsuch asfinder’s fees, legal fees, due diligence fees, and other professional and
consulting fees are expensed as incurred. The transaction costs of ₹7 crore related to the acquisition have been included under administrative expenses in the
Interim Condensed Consolidated Statement of Statement of Profit or Loss for the year ended March 31, 2023.

Accounting policy
Property,plantandequipmentarestatedatcost,lessaccumulateddepreciationandimpairment,ifany.Costsdirectlyattributabletoacquisitionarecapitalizeduntiltheproperty,plantandequipment
are ready for use, as intended by the Management. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived at after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected
residual value atthe end ofitslife. The Group depreciates property, plantand equipment over their estimated usefullives usingthe straight-line method. The estimated usefullives ofassets are as
follows:
Buildings (1) 22-25 years
Plant and machinery (1)(2) 5 years

economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial
statements upon sale or retirement of the asset.
Impairment
Property, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of
impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash
flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
Ifsuchassetsare considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized intheConsolidated StatementofProfitand Lossismeasuredbytheamountbywhichthecarryingvalueoftheassets

determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.
The changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are as follows:

132.3 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
2.3.1 Goodwill
Accounting policy
GoodwillrepresentsthepurchaseconsiderationinexcessoftheGroup'sinterestinthenetfairvalueofidentifiableassets,liabilitiesandcontingentliabilitiesoftheacquiredentity.Whenthenetfair
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, the fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain purchase gain is
recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the
impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit fromthe synergies of the acquisition and which represents the lowestlevel atwhich goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of its fair
value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. Value-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived fromthe CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flowprojections are prepared
based on current economic conditions and includes estimated long term growth rates, weighted average cost of capital and estimated operating margins.
Following is a summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill:
(In ₹ crore)
Particulars As at
March 31, 2024 March 31, 2023

Goodwill on acquisitions (Refer to note 2.1) — 630
Translation differences 55 423
Carrying value at the end 7,303 7,248
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
2.3.2 Intangible Assets
Accounting policy
Intangibleassetsarestatedatcostlessaccumulatedamortizationandimpairment.Intangibleassetsareamortizedovertheirrespectiveindividualestimatedusefullivesonastraight-linebasis,from
the date that theyare available for use. The estimated usefullife ofan identifiable intangible asset is based on a number offactors includingthe effectsof obsolescence, demand, competition, and
othereconomicfactors(suchasthestabilityoftheindustry,andknowntechnologicaladvances)andthelevelofmaintenanceexpendituresrequiredtoobtaintheexpectedfuturecashflowsfromthe
asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.
Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibilityof the project is demonstrated, future economic
benefitsare probable, the Group has anintentionand abilityto complete and use or sellthe software and the costscanbe measured reliably. The costswhichcan be capitalized include the costof
material, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.

performanceobligationbasedontherelativestandalonesellingprice.Thepricethatisregularlychargedforanitemwhensoldseparatelyisthe bestevidence ofitsstandaloneselling
price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of
satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.
The Group’s contracts may include variable consideration including rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price

patternofbenefitsfromthe servicesrendered to the customer and the Group’s coststo fulfil the contract is not even throughthe period of contract because the services are generally
discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the
percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.
Progresstowardscompletionismeasured asthe ratio ofcostsor effortsincurred to date (representingworkperformed) to the estimated total costsor efforts. Estimates oftransaction
price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates
are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts are
recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.
The billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic performance based billing and / or milestone based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as
unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).
In arrangements for software development and related services and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the
arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction
price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item

Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include multiple elements which may be subject to other specific accounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts
are accounted in accordance with such specific accounting guidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to determine that hardware and services are distinct performance
obligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the

determine whether it controls the specified goods or services and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.
A contract modification is a change in the scope or price or both of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract. A contract modification that results in the addition of
distinct performance obligations are accounted for either as a separate contract if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price or as a termination of the existing

Disaggregated revenue information
Revenue disaggregation by business segments has been included in segment information (Refer to Note 2.23). The table below presents disaggregated revenues from contracts with
customers by geography and contract type. The Group believes that this disaggregation best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are
affected by industry, market and other economic factors.

Trade Receivables and Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in receivables, unbilled revenue, and unearned revenue on the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts
are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.
TheGroup’sreceivablesarerightstoconsiderationthatareunconditional. Unbilledrevenuescomprisingrevenuesinexcessofbillingsfromtimeandmaterialcontractsandfixedprice
maintenance contracts are classified as financial asset when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time.
Invoicing to the clients for other fixed price contracts is based on milestones as defined inthe contract and therefore the timingof revenue recognition isdifferent fromthe timingof
invoicing to the customers. Therefore unbilled revenues for other fixed price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is
dependent on completion of contractual milestones.
Invoicing in excess of earnings are classified as unearned revenue.
Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of impairment in the consolidated Balance Sheet.

Group’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is
reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.
Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes
these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.
The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or
prior to the commencement date ofthe lease plus anyinitial direct costs lessanylease incentives. Theyare subsequentlymeasured atcost lessaccumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying
asset.
Right-of-useassetsareevaluatedforrecoverabilitywhenevereventsorchangesincircumstancesindicatethattheircarryingamountsmaynotberecoverable.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an
individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable
amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.
The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the
interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease
liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset ifthe Group changes itsassessment ifwhether itwill exercise an
extension or a termination option.
Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.
32The Group as a lessor
Leases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
WhentheGroupisanintermediatelessor,itaccountsforitsinterestsinthe headlease andthe subleaseseparately. Thesublease isclassified asa financeor
operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
For operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

362X19AOX18AO .23 SEGMENT REPORTING
Ind AS 108, Operating segments, establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments and related disclosures
about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable
clientstoenhancebusinessperformance.TheChiefOperatingDecisionMaker(CODM)evaluatestheGroup'sperformanceandallocatesresourcesbasedonananalysisof
various performance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting principles used in the
preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.
Business segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged
Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech,
enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. The Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services
operating segment and Finacle operating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of
businesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other enterprises in Public Services.

services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses,
which are categorized in relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant component of
total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not practical to
provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately disclosed as "unallocated" and adjusted against the total
income of the Group.
Assets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably between segments. The
Managementbelievesthatitiscurrentlynotpracticabletoprovidesegmentdisclosuresrelatingtototalassetsandliabilitiessinceameaningfulsegregationoftheavailable

Business segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is otherwise recognized.
Disclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in note 2.16 Revenue from operations.
